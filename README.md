# Exploring and Predicting Hospital Readmission Risk Using PCA and K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on analyzing the readmission patterns using cluster analysis and predicting hospital readmissions for diabetic patients using logistic regression. The goal is to identify key factors that influence early readmissions and build a predictive model that can assist healthcare providers in proactive patient management.

## Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to understand and predict hospital readmissions among diabetic patients.
Specifically, the project aims to:

- Predict the likelihood of early hospital readmission using logistic regression.
- Identify the strongest predictors influencing patient readmission risk.
- Reduce dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify complex clinical variables.
- Segment patients into distinct groups using clustering techniques to uncover hidden patterns and inform targeted interventions.

By combining predictive modeling, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised learning, this project provides a comprehensive approach to both predictive analytics and patient profiling for hospital readmission management.

## Data
- The dataset is stored in the diabetic_data.csv file.
- It contains patient encounter records including demographics, medical history, and hospital visit information.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the dataset stored in diabetic_data.csv file.
3. Open the `Hospital Readmission Prediction.ipynb` notebook.
4. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`
5. Follow the notebook steps sequentially - Run each block one after another.
